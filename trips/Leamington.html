<p>Date: 12/03/2022 Getting there - We drove but there is a train station (Leamington Spa railway station) where there are links London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill and onwards to Kidderminster (Chiltern Main Line).</p>

<p>Royal Leamington Spa is a town in the county of Warwickshire. The 'Royal' prefix was granted by Queen Victoria who visited the town in 1830 and again in 1858. Interestingly, the town water was thought to have medicinal properties and this resulted in the population of the town starting to grow in the 19th century. Nowadays Leamington Spa is home to lovely cafes, restaurants, independent shops, live music venues, and parks and was even ranked the happiest place to live in Britain. We thought it worth a day trip..</p>

<p>Our first stop was The Muse Coffee House (http://www.themusecoffeehouse.co.uk/) for a coffee and cake. The Muse is a lovely little cafe with a friendly team who greeted most customers by name - I thought to myself it was likely a local favourite. Although there were not a lot of seating spaces, the decor was minimal and stylish with light wooden tables, potted plants and lots of natural light so it felt very open and tranquil. It would be a nice environment to do a bit of work in (which some people were) - there was wifi and light music playing. The Muse also sold pottery and mugs as well as blankets, candles and environmental products like tin lunch boxes and beautiful jewellery. The cafe served a selection of hot drinks (different coffees, teas and hot chocolate), fresh cakes and open sandwiches. Although some of the sandwiches had sold out, there were 5 cakes to choose from, including a vegan option (lemon cake). We sat in the window seat in the bay window and enjoyed a slice of the Victoria sponge loaf and the Bakewell with lemon curd as well as americano and oat flat white (&pound;12.80). Everything was delicious - I would highly recommend a visit when you&rsquo;re next in Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>We also did a bit of shopping - the shopping arcade (Royal Priors Shopping Centre) is a little depressing but there are lots of interesting charity shops and a brilliant Oxfam bookshop. Leamington is also home to one of my favourite shops in the country, Bery Lune (https://www.berylune.co.uk/). It's an independent store which houses the most beautiful things from pottery to linen cushions, plants and dried flowers, vases, candles, kids toys, natural beauty products and an amazing array of cards - it's as if someone put all my favourite things under one roof. Do not leave Leamington until you have popped in!</p>

<p>We then walked around Jephson Gardens which are next to the River Leam (which is how Leamington got its name). These well kept gardens are lovely and calming place. The gardens have ponds (with ducks, geese and swans), a fountain, a sensory garden and a glasshouse with exotic plants. There are also public toilets and a small cafe which sells hot and cold drinks and sandwiches and snacks.</p>

<p>After the walk we tried to get a table at Hayashi Japanese Restaurant as soon as it opened at 5.30pm but they said they were booked right up until close; a number of other independents were also fully booked so I would definitely recommend booking on a Saturday evening! In the end we were lucky to get a seat at Bodega Cantina which is a South American restaurant cocktail bar with locations in Birmingham, Leicester, Worcester and Leamington Spa. The food and the atmosphere were great - especially the huge plate of nachos..</p>

<p>Other places to check out: Carisma tapas &amp; wine bar (https://carisma-tapas.co.uk/) Midland Oak - a special oak tree located to the northeast of the town centre which grew near the spot and was reputed to be at the centre of England (or so the plaque states!) Leamington Spa Art Gallery &amp; Museum - in the Royal Pump Rooms, holds a collection of over 12,000 objects art and some things relating to local history</p>
